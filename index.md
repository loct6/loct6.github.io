I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 1
Lab 6 is my favorite because I learned how to use command line arguments to change the output of a program. I like seeing how the sandwich sentence changed based on what I typed. Lab 6 made coding feel more fun and creative.

* Lab 9, part 2
Lab 9 is my favorite because I learned how to read and write files in C++. It was cool that two programs worked together to make a game. I felt kind of excited when the game finally worked because we spent a lot of time fixing and working on it.

* Lab 10, part 1
Lab 10 is my favorite because I learned how to search for information inside a vector. It was interesting to find a county’s population and show the percentage. This lab helped me a lot with using data in C++ programs.
